## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using a div which was assigned multiple css classes, we can create the the "illusion" of a pop-up by
modifying the z-index of the markup as well as introducing slide-down and slide-up animations.
Based on whether we want to show/close the pop-up, we can use Javascript to modify the 'display' property
of the aforementioned div.

## Lessons Learned:

It is always refreshing to see how much impact some small animations can have on rather mundane objects.

Any respectable web developer should revise once in a while css animations (transform, translate, keyframes, etc.).
